# Hardware-Designs-Max10-FPGA
Basic digital hardware designs that are synthesized and implemented on Max10 FPGA using Intel Quartus Prime Lite and ModelSim Altera. </br>
The designs are first verified traditionally using test-bench and tested using scan-chain (not always exhaustively). <br/>
They are then wrapped using a standard interfacing system and interfaced with NIOS-II processor using Platform Designer (formerly Qsys). </br>
Eclipse IDE is used to write C-codes that illustrate the utility of these hardware designs in practical applications. </br>

1) 4x4 Matrix Inversion over Galois Field 2
2) 8-point Number Theoretic Transform over 16-bit Field
3) XOR Neural Network using 16-bit Fixed Point Representation and LUT-based Sigmoid Function
4) 4-tap Low Pass FIR Filter using 16-bit Fixed Point Representation
